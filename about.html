  <h2>Our Faith</h2>
  <p>
    We belong to the Jacobite Syrian Orthodox Church, part of the
    ancient Oriental Orthodox communion tracing its roots to the
    Apostolic See of Antioch.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our worship follows the West Syriac Rite, rich in prayer,
    hymnody, scripture, and sacramental life.
